      <title>Goodbye iterm2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve used iTerm 2 for a few years now but came to the realization that I don’t actually use any of its features. Mac’s built in terminal is more than enough for my needs. See ya later iTerm 2 and thanks for being rock solid all these years.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Lessons learned from starting a business while working full time.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I started working on <a href="http://collatenotes.com/">Collate</a> in December of 2016. I was dissatisfied with the note taking apps on the market and wanted a tool that would work for my needs. I had been toying with the idea and finally started writing code over the Christmas holiday. I had a basic prototype built with Electron, bootstrap and jQuery by February, then rebuilt it with Electron, Vue.js and Bulma from scratch because the code base was terrible. Today, Collate is profitable, has a couple hundred users, was featured on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/collate-is-a-privacy-focused-evernote-style-notes-app-1794500652">Lifehacker</a> and is doing well by my standards. Here are some hard learned lessons from the last 8 months of working on Collate while maintaining a full time job:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have a tight scope — I made the mistake of saying yes to everything and pretty soon Collate began heading in a direction I wasn’t happy with. Users will ask for features, it’s only natural. It’s extremely easy to bloat the scope of your project if you say yes to everything. Having an extremely tight scope of what your project does and provides is essential to focus the small amount of time you have to devote to the project. I’m working on the next iteration of Collate and it will be extremely pared down.</li>
<li>Use what you know — Use technology you know like the back of your hand. This advice is given a lot and for good reason. If you need to spend time learning a new piece of tech, it’s time away from making your product more stable. I use Wordpress in my day job, so it’s only natural I use it for my product’s site. It’s not sexy but it works.</li>
<li>If you have to learn new tech, experiment and choose what works for you — Other times you might not know how to use the right technology for the job. In these cases experiment and see what works best for your needs. I went with Vue.js for the second iteration of Collate because I was working on a project at work that utilized it. Using it in both places helped both projects immensely.</li>
<li>Charge money — This is one thing I’m glad I got right from the start thanks to advice from <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and other startup founders. Charge money from the get-go and get customers comfortable paying for your product. Collate was profitable the second week out of release. The money gives you a cushion to experiment and grow the business. Since I’m working full time, all profits go back into the project to pay for things like servers, lawyers, and third party services I may use.</li>
<li>It’s okay to not respond to emails — Customer service is a very time consuming task. I made the mistake of replying to each and every email in the beginning, usually with long explanations of what I was doing and my plans. With limited time, choose your service requests carefully and try to minimize time spent on it. It doesn’t mean you don’t care, you’re just prioritizing. I got to a point where I would dread opening up my inbox, after I stopped responding to everything, things got a lot more manageable.</li>
<li>Get your legal ducks in a row — If you’re going to collect money for your project, spend a little up front as soon as you can afford to and get all your legal stuff squared away. I started my corporate entity (Collate, LLC) through a corporate filing company in my state. Opened a bank account with the same bank I use for my personal accounts. Then, got my End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy looked at by an attorney I found on <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/rf/pQ3CZlfu">Upcounsel</a>.</li>
<li>Think about marketing — You don’t have to be a marketing wiz but consider it while building out the product. At the very minimum, start early by building a email list of people interested in your product. You don’t have to constantly market to your list but its useful to have people to notify when you have something to announce.</li>
<li>Pace yourself — I wish I had learned this lesson sooner. I worked on Collate furiously for the first six months, pumping out feature after feature and release after release. I was putting in close to 40 hours a week on nights and weekends working on Collate after work for a while. I got so burnt out that I had to step away from the project and try working on something else (and even not working on anything!). I’m back on it now, but working on it at a much slower pace. Take the time to decompress each day, get exercise and make sure to sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Side projects while working full time are a lot of work but also very rewarding. The best part for me was building something from scratch that I’m passionate about building, something that I don’t get at my day job. It’s also pretty great to build something and then watch other people get excited about it.</p>]]></description>

      <title>I should have learned more bash sooner</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bash tools are super powerful once you get a hang of using it. This whole blog is pretty much <a href="https://github.com/patleeman/patricklee.nyc/">a bunch of scripts and Pandoc</a>. Its pretty cool what you can build once you get over the learning curve.</p>
<p>I’m a few years into my career now and I’ve only really used shell scripts when working with CI. I’ve never felt totally comfortable with it, maybe it’s because it feels like casting spells by uttering some obscure incantations? I mean look at one of the lines I put together to sort an array for this blog:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">IFS</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">$&#39;</span><span class="dt">
</span><span class="st">&#39;</span> <span class="va">SORTED_POSTS</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="va">(</span> <span class="va">$(</span><span class="cf">for</span> j <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">${POSTS</span><span class="op">[@]</span><span class="va">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="cf">do</span> <span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="va">$j</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="cf">done</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">sort</span> <span class="at">-t</span> <span class="st">&quot;;&quot;</span> <span class="at">-k</span> 1 <span class="at">-nr</span><span class="va">)</span> <span class="va">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does all this mean? <code>IFS=$'
'</code> Hackily set the internal separator to newline so it stops breaking my strings up by spaces <code>$(for j in "${POSTS[@]}"; do echo $j; done | sort -t ";" -k 1 -nr)</code> Loop through the $POSTS array (not shown) and sort by the first column delineated by ; <code>SORTED_POSTS=( ... )</code> Create an array from the output of the previous command</p>
<p>Hell, this probably isn’t even the right way to do what I wanted it to do, but it works for my use case. What’s really cool though is just how powerful and terse it is. The difficulty lies in getting started with it.</p>
<p>Some of the Pros and Cons I’ve encountered so far:</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Portable between many different systems</li>
<li>Plenty of information available online</li>
<li>Very powerful and terse</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning curve is steep</li>
<li>Lots of different ways to do X but somebody on the internet will tell you you’re wrong</li>
<li>Readability is not very good. If you want to share scripts with a team, you might want to choose something like Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if I were to advise my slightly younger self:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a few days and learn how to write bash scripts.</li>
<li>Read up on the basics of bash scripting.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/">Learn X in Y seconds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide">Bash Guide</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try writing some scripts to automate things (like setting up your <a href="https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a> sooner)</li>
<li>If you find yourself reaching to some programming language to do something, try doing it in bash first.</li>
<li>Don’t bother with anything complicated interactively. Create a script file and execute it if its anything more than a one liner.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

      <title>Lessons learned from dabbling in the stock market</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve dabbled in investing in the past but over the last two years I’ve really gotten involved heavily with managing my portfolio. I’m still a complete amateur but I did pick up some very valuable lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve started to attach probabilities to events way more than I used to. This has the benefit of helping me think about potential events more objectively.</li>
<li>There is a zen to riding the highs and lows of the market. It takes confidence in a long term game plan, diversification, and some good ole detachment in order to psychologically bear the swings.</li>
<li>I learned not to go into a trade without an exit plan (still working on actualizing this one).</li>
<li>The more you risk, the more you could potentially be rewarded.</li>
<li>You could also lose everything in one bad trade. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.</li>
<li>Leverage is a powerful and dangerous tool. Use it with extreme caution.</li>
<li>A stock’s price usually reached an equilibrium until some catalyst occurs. The same could be said about life, usually we reach some steady state until a catalyzing life event occurs.
<ul>
<li><strong>TODO: explore how to introduce catalysts in a more consistent manner.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Companies rise and fall on a regular basis. What seems like a juggernaut one year may implode the next. Same for companies that seem to be worthless can be turned around and brought back from the grave.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

      <title>Hot takes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to reduce the barrier to entry to writing blog posts, I’m introducing hot takes. A low effort way for me to put unpolished thoughts into the wild. It’s like twitter but without having to deal with any baggage.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Striving for dispassionateness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="striving-for-dispassionateness">Striving for dispassionateness</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Not influenced by strong feelings or emotions; impartial</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/dispassionateness#:~:text=dispassionateness-,noun,%2C%20nonpartisanship%2C%20objectiveness%2C%20objectivity.">Definition</a></p>
<p>As I continue on my leadership journey managing the Growth engineering team at Noom, one aspect of my personality I’ve been trying to work on is detachment. I have a mantra “Strive for dispassionateness” that I plastered on top of my personal goals to remind me to continue to detach myself from emotions. Dispassionateness or detachment as I’ve defined it is the process of removing emotion from the decision making process to reduce the impact of bias and to try to make the best decisions possible.</p>
<p>My coworker Nikhil, the VP of Growth at Noom is my model for dispassionateness. I’ve worked with him for four years now and in this time I’ve had a glimpse into how he handles making difficult decisions and accepting hard feedback. He does it with thoughtfulness, without ego, and kindness. Its quite impressive to see.</p>
<p>I’m an emotional person, I feel strong emotions which can bias my decision making process. This personality trait has hurt me in the past. I’ve been in situations where I have a hard time forming sentences, breathing gets difficult, vision blurs. Getting overwhelmed by emotions is truly an awful experience. The adrenaline pumps as the fight or flight response kicks in, paralyzing your mind in indecision, and impairing your ability to think. I’m a conflict-adverse introvert. I hate conflict, but as a people manager and leader there is no avoiding conflict sometimes. You will eventually get pulled into it, especially in a fast moving organization with many different people with their own biases, goals, and opinions.</p>
<p>Disconnecting yourself from emotions isn’t burying your emotions. Its a process of introspection and learning what your current emotional state is, and either working to return to my baseline state, or removing myself from the situation. A few things that I’ve learned:</p>
<h1 id="understanding-what-affects-my-mood">Understanding what affects my mood</h1>
<ul>
<li>If I’m hungry or if I didn’t get enough sleep, I’ll often become irritable.</li>
<li>When I exercise regularly in the mornings, I set myself up to be in a better head space.</li>
<li>I burn out if I don’t take vacations often or there are other compounding stressors. How close to burnout is important for me to keep tabs on. The closer I am, the more erratic my behavior will be and the less passionate I will be about work.</li>
<li>As it gets closer to the end of the day, I get tired and can more easily get irritable.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-when-to-stop-and-take-a-breather">Understanding when to stop and take a breather</h1>
<p>Sometimes people send me a message or email that spike my blood pressure. I’ve found that if something triggers me, taking a step back to think about it or let it bake helps a lot. I’ve found a lot of success putting something down, then picking it up again the next morning when I’m fresh and in a better head space. The scope of problems tend to be smaller the farther you get from it and initial reactions are usually overblown.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-when-to-dig-in">Understanding when to dig in</h1>
<p>Speaking of initial reactions, one of my flaws is overreacting based on my initial reaction. Its easy to do so, but generally taking some time to investigate and dig in before gauging the severity of it is beneficial and something I actively work on. Its very easy to experience something, scream “WHAT?”, go on a tear and make things works. It takes discipline and detachment to stop, investigate, and ask questions, then thoughtfully determine the impact and next steps.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-when-to-let-things-fall-by-the-wayside.">Understanding when to let things fall by the wayside.</h1>
<p>If you’re doing a good job, people are going to want you to do more. Knowing when to let things fall by the wayside (which is different from letting things slip through the cracks) is an invaluable skill.</p>]]></description>

      <title>An ode to my linter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<pre><code>Oh my dearest linter,
adding squiggly lines under my mistake.
Gently teaching me why I&#39;m wrong.
How do I fix it?
Some help would be nice.
You autocorrected it! Thank you twice!

The documentation is right at hand:
&quot;you idiot, don&#39;t add an ampersand!&quot;
But I think you might be wrong,
my dear linter this is an edge case!
Well then I&#39;ll just have to add
a little comment to disable that
tiny check on line 35.
I&#39;m sorry my linter,
you&#39;ll have to abide.

      <title>Note taking hell</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="note-taking-hell">Note taking hell</h1>
<p>I have a hard time sticking with a note taking system. I think at this point I’ve tested all the major note taking tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evernote</li>
<li>OneNote</li>
<li>Simple note</li>
<li>Turtl</li>
<li>Google keep</li>
<li>Standard Notes</li>
<li>Workflowy</li>
<li>Bear</li>
<li>todo.txt</li>
<li>plain text markdown files</li>
<li>Omni notes</li>
<li>Apple Notes</li>
<li>Obsidian</li>
<li>Notion</li>
<li>Roam Research</li>
<li>Athens Resarch</li>
<li>Coda</li>
<li>Mem.ai (currently trying out)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also built and sold a now defunct note taking app called <a href="https://github.com/Collateapp/CollateNotes">Collate Notes</a> as well as a VS Code plugin called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes">VSNotes</a>.</p>
<p>I can’t settle on anything! My notes, tasks, etc are scattered across various services and no one service seems to be able to keep my attention for long. I keep looking for that note taking panacea that will organize my life and help me become more productive, however everything I try always seems to come up short in some way, shape or form.</p>
<p>Notion is a favorite of mine, it had really great flexibility… but too much flexibility. It functioned great for writing nice looking documents, but failed at jotting down small tidbits quickly. I felt like I spent too much time making documents look nice instead of actually using the tool.</p>
<p>Roam Research was really nice. It introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> which is a neat concept. However I dropped it because Roam was expensive and lacked polish. In it’s stead I tried Athens Research and Obsidian, both were pretty meh.</p>
<p>Plain text note taking is all the rage with minimalists. I’m a big fan of markdown for documentation (this blog is written in markdown). For notes, it was okay. Interoperability between services usually sucks. Pasting raw markdown into a Google doc will just result in a bunch of markdown formatting in a google doc, so that doesn’t work. Syncing data is also a bigger pain with plain text. Do you use Git? A service like dropbox? Then on mobile your tool needs to work with these services.</p>
<p>It’s a nightmare!</p>
<h2 id="i-have-no-idea-what-i-want">I have no idea what I want</h2>
<p>Do I want a writing tool? Do I want a way to manage tasks? Do I want a way to be reminded of things? Do I want a way to manage a knowledge base? Do I need a bookmarking tool? Will I ever look at these notes ever again? How do I reconcile the Google Docs heavy world that my work org operates in? Do I want a dashboard that I can keep up all day to jot down notes, see my meetings, etc?</p>
<p>I would love having all these things in a single tool, but that’s not feasible. Its basically an operating system at that point. The services that try end up sucking. The services that don’t end up lacking. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.</p>
<h2 id="im-so-lazy">I’m so lazy</h2>
<p>I would love to be able to just automate stuff too. Click a button in slack and a todo item pops up in my tool or bookmark this link and it shows up in my notes. Integrations are great, interoperability between services means that I can pipe data from this service into my online brain. However very rarely does it do what you actually want. APIs don’t play nice, data isn’t available, hell a lot of these services don’t even have APIs. What is one to do?</p>
<p>The promise of a 2nd brain, in the cloud, ready to be queried that offloads the work of thinking. Isn’t that the dream? To be able to think a thought and have it appear in a personal knowledge base to be ingested and understood by a machine? Then spat back out to you at the appropriate time and place? Barring having a hyper intelligent machine, what is one to do?</p>
<h2 id="i-think-i-need-to-designate-scopes">I think I need to designate scopes</h2>
<p>I need to pick several tools and keep them in their lanes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Calendar: Google Calendar</li>
<li>Reminders: Apple Reminders</li>
<li>Jotting down ideas: Whatever is nearby?</li>
<li>Writing: Google Docs / Markdown (depends on context)</li>
<li>Bookmarking: Raindrop.io</li>
</ol>
<p>I think leveraging a tool like raindrop.io will help me keep all these various notes organized in a central location… at least until I get bored of maintaining it…</p>]]></description>

      <title>My walking desk setup</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of 2020 and 2021 I’ve become increasingly sedentary with lockdown and full remote work. Having gone from commuting into the office 1-2 times a week down to zero meant I had less opportunity to walk. Along with the birth of my son and having less time and energy to exercise I needed to find a way to integrate more walking into my routine. If I could figure out how to exercise while working then I would have more time to spend on more interesting things, a win-win situation!</p>
<p>I’ve seen treadmill desks before and was motivated after seeing one of my coworkers on one during a meeting. So I decided to pick up a treadmill and give it a shot.</p>
<p><img src="/public/blog/20211228_my_walking_desk_setup.md/1.png" /></p>
<p><em>This is my humble treadmill desk.</em></p>
<h1 id="the-treadmill">The treadmill</h1>
<p>There are a lot of treadmills on the market of varying quality. I knew that I didn’t need a high end treadmill since I was only going to walk on it. Space is an issue, so I wanted something that could fold away if I had company and needed to use my office as a guest room. Finally I wanted to make sure the product had a warranty and a presence in the US in case something happened with the product. There are plenty of dodgy looking walking treadmills on Amazon and I just didn’t want to take the chance of getting a piece of junk.</p>
<p>This pretty much narrowed my choices down to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://treadly.co/order-treadly-2">Treadly 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.lifespanfitness.com/products/tr1200-dt3-under-desk-treadmill?_pos=4&amp;_psq=tr1200&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0">LifeSpan TR1200</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the LifeSpan TR1200 was a more solid choice, I decided to go with the smaller, sleeker and most importantly cheaper Treadly 2. My impressions of the treadly so far after about a month of usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its heavier than I had expected. The build quality is good, it feels rugged and pretty solid.</li>
<li>I didn’t get the one with the bluetooth and I kinda wish I spent the extra money and gotten it. Since I’m stationary at a desk, my Apple watch doesn’t record the steps properly and being able to sync Apple Health to the Treadly would have been nice. It’s no big deal though. You can upgrade to the pro version but it requires paying the difference and shipping back the existing treadmill.</li>
<li>A pile of black rubber accumulates at the back of the treadmill after a walk. I think it’s rubber off the bottom of my shoes getting rubbed off, at least I hope it is. It would not be great if this was the belt disintegrating, but I don’t see any wear on it so far.</li>
<li>The hand rail is covered by my desk so it’s functionally useless, I just use the included remote to start and stop the treadmill. The handrail feels pretty solid though and it’s folding mechanism is pretty solid.</li>
<li>It has a bluetooth speaker but I don’t have a need for it.</li>
<li>The speed increments are in MPH and I’ve found my comfortable walking speed is about 2.1 MPH. I don’t know how accurate speed or step counter are but that doesn’t really matter all that much.</li>
<li>I only use the manual mode since I want the treadmill to set the pace and all I have to do is keep up. The Treadly 2 has an automatic mode that adjusts the speed based on where on the treadmill you’re walking. Further up and it speeds up, further back and it slows down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m pretty happy with this treadmill!</p>
<h1 id="the-setup">The setup</h1>
<p>I have a standing desk which I had planned on using as my treadmill desk. The plan was to set up the treadmill in the morning then move it out of the way when I was finished so I could sit/stand the rest of the day. I tried this a few days and realized that I needed to have a dedicated setup for the treadmill desk and that it had to live somewhere semi-permanently. Having to set up the treadmill attributed some friction to actually using it which meant I was less likely to use it.</p>
<p>So I cleared some space in my office, purchased a relatively cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093GLT2QY?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details">Tangkula adjustable standing desk</a> off of Amazon and repurposed some extra peripherals I had laying around. I also purchased a Logitech C920x webcam for this setup so I could take video calls while on the treadmill desk.</p>

<p><em>On the desk: Split Keyboard, Apple Trackpad, wrist rests, Logitech C920x, LG 34” Ultrawide monitor, Ergotron monitor arm, Treadly 2 remote</em></p>
<p>When everything came, I realized that the standing desk needed to raised over the treadmill so it could slide underneath the desk setup. This is important because this cheap standing desk is relatively shallow and I needed to be centered in the middle of the treadmill so the desk had to be slid back. To solve this problem, I just bought some cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QVJMWTD?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details">6” bed risers</a> which gave the desk enough height so it could clear the treadmill.</p>
<p>I also have a small fan that blows me while I’m walking since I get pretty warm after walking a while. The fan helps a lot.</p>

<p><em>The desk is raised over the treadmill with the bed risers and the fan helps keep me cool while I walk.</em></p>
<h1 id="using-it">Using it</h1>
<p>My goal is 10,000 steps per day and I’ve found that I’m able to complete that in about three hours at a leisurely 2.1 MPH pace. The first few weeks I was pretty tired and didn’t walk every day. It does take a period of acclimation to go from mostly sedentary to walking the equivalent of 2-3 miles a day so I wasn’t kicking myself for not hitting my goal. Ultimately I want to build a long lasting healthy habit so I’m taking it slow and working up to my goal.</p>
<p>Some of my impressions after several weeks of daily usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find that walking doesn’t impede with my flow state. I’m able to write code or documents just fine while walking. I’m writing this blog post while walking. The constant pace and repetitiveness of it isn’t distracting so it’s quite easy to forget I’m on a treadmill after a while.</li>
<li>I usually spend about 2 hours on the treadmill in the mornings. More if I have meetings and need to stop walking so I can interact in the meeting. Ideally I’d block off time for walking in the mornings and is something I will be exploring. I’ve had a few times where my mornings were jam packed with meetings which caused me to miss my walk. Once I get going its hard to switch gears and move to the treadmill in the afternoons.</li>
<li>Walking can be distracting in meetings. For meetings I need to be highly engaged I usually stop the treadmill but stay standing. For low engagement meetings I’ll keep walking. Walking and talking leaves me breathless so I usually need to stop if I enter a discussion. This should be less of a problem as I acclimate and get healthier.</li>
<li>I’m constantly drinking water while walking, no spills yet! Haven’t tried drinking hot coffee yet, though I might just skip that.</li>
<li>I keep a pair of shorts, socks and my walking shoes next to the treadmill so I have no excuses to not walk.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’m really enjoying my walking desk. I’m getting in physical activity where I’d otherwise be sitting at my desk. My work is getting done and I’m able to optimize my time outside work for other things I enjoy doing (like hanging out with my family)!</p>
<p>My key takeaways from this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I expect myself to use this walking desk there needs to be almost no barriers to me hopping at any time.</li>
<li>Creating a comfortable setup (keyboard, trackpad, monitor, etc) that is very similar to my desk setup is important. If I tried to work off my laptop instead of with external monitors and peripherals like I normally do I think I would be way less motivated to hop over to the standing desk.</li>
<li>Walking is great!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve been considering a walking desk, I’d highly recommend trying it out. Just make sure you have the space to dedicate to it. You can always pick up a cheap used treadmill and rig up a desk setup.</p>]]></description>

      <title>From Community College to Columbia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I dropped out of college at twenty. The next few years were spent at various jobs until I ended up as a legal assistant at a law firm. The firm was filled with fax machines, typewriters, and massive paper files. What was the norm in 1988 was still the norm in the legal industry at the time. It was a slow moving beast, mired in paper and yesterday’s technology. I wanted to work with modern technology and be part of the future but there was no future for an aimless college dropout. I couldn’t see a way forward, so I went back.</p>
<h3 id="the-borough-of-manhattan-community-college">The Borough of Manhattan Community College</h3>
<p>Community college was an eye-opening experience. On one hand you had the highly motivated students, usually older, who had experienced life first hand. Many had full time jobs, kids, and experience working low wage jobs. Most of the ones I met worked in retail or dead end jobs, and college for them was a ticket out of their daily struggle and into a comfortable future. On the other hand, you had the unmotivated students, usually younger and straight out of high school. Most treated it as an extension of high school, 13th and 14th grade, as a way to defer working for a little bit. While I could sympathize with them, I fell into the former group of students. I was motivated, but I lacked a clear picture of where I wanted to be. My idea of dreaming big was a degree from the local four year college and a modest job doing something better than what I had been doing at the law firm. At this point, I was doing well in school, working my way through a business management degree, content with my potential future. Who knew that taking a mandatory speech class, and randomly choosing a time slot that worked well with my schedule would land me with a professor that would change my life?</p>
<p>My Speech 101 professor, Dr. Poster, is a long time teacher and administrator at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). She has a reputation of being a tough teacher, who expects a lot from her students and will hold them to a high standard. While plenty of her colleagues passed students who handed in sub par work, she held firm and expected quality work. She has an uncanny ability to see the best in her students, and to push them hard to realize their potential. Which is what she did with me. She brought me into her office one day and asked me about my plans for the future, what I wanted to do with my life, and where I saw myself going after I finished at BMCC. I gave her the rough layout of my college and career goals. Then she dropped a bomb on me.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you apply to Columbia?”</p>
<p>I had never even given Columbia serious consideration. That seemed way out of my reach, me, a college dropout in a no-name community college. I wasn’t a savant, I hadn’t done anything truly worthwhile, what chance did I have? She convinced me that it was worth trying and helped connect me to some people who could help with the application process. To my amazement, I got in.</p>
<h3 id="columbia-university">Columbia University</h3>
<p>Walking through the gates on 116th street and Broadway the first time was surreal. Stepping onto the Columbia grounds gives you the feeling that you’ve been transported miles away from New York City. I walked through rows of trees lining the main entrance which drew me into the center of campus. To the left were the stairs leading to Low Library, and to the right grassy fields and cleanly trimmed hedges leading to Butler Library. I can only describe the feeling as a sort of reverence, standing in this place where many generations of students have come and gone. A sort of… temple to the religion of academia. I had lived in New York City my entire life and had never known there was such a place.</p>
<p>My first semester there, I took a “relatively light” load of four classes while still working part time. Very quickly, I realized that four classes was <strong>not</strong> a light load and I had to quit my job. If I was going to pass my classes, showing up and doing homework was not enough. I was under water my first week of classes, drowning under the crushing weight of the volume, frequency, and difficulty of the work. It turns out that community college had not adequately prepared me for the rigors of real academia. Classes were much harder, especially since I was majoring in Economics-Mathematics, a major which combined the two disciplines and was similar to completing 80% of both degrees. To survive in this tough academic environment, you enter a sort of perpetual fight or flight mode. Fear had a lot to do with the stress. Fear of failing a class and extending my stay another semester with the associated costs. Fear of failing out of the school, leaving with significant debt without a degree to show for it. Fear that now that I had reached for the stars, I would fail and come crashing back to the ground. All these fears would be my main motivator and subsequently the reason I was able to graduate on time.</p>
<p>I’d best describe the time between when a semester begins and when it ends as a long slow grind. You’re grinding out work, studying, reading, writing and problem sets. Once you complete a task, work begins on the next one, over and over until it’s time to sleep. In community college the bar is set a lot lower, mostly because the bar of students is a lot lower. Teachers expected average work and students presented a wide range of quality. At Columbia, I noticed that the range of quality was a lot smaller, and the quality of work was a lot higher. This meant that in order to be an average student at Columbia, I needed to work harder than I’d ever worked at BMCC. I had friends who were top students at BMCC, who were accepted to Columbia at the same time as I was. They echoed similar sentiments about the intensity of the work. I had thought of myself as an average student at best, and here were people I had considered harder working and smarter than myself struggling to get by.</p>
<p>There was an aura of stress surrounding the student body. As my time at Columbia progressed, I noticed I started showing it as well. I don’t know if this was an experience unique to Columbia, top tier schools, or just college in general but I do know that during my time at BMCC I had never experienced that dreadful fear of failing a class. At BMCC the worst that could happen was that I would get a C. At Columbia the worst was failing a class and throwing away thousands of dollars as a result. On the flip side, however, I’ve never seen as many hard-working people in one place in my entire life. The maturity and discipline it took for these students to buckle down and study was inspirational for me. It helped to be surrounded by these hard-working students. I fed off the energy of my fellow students. I found it refreshing to be surrounded by people who were motivated especially coming from an environment where a fraction of your grade was determined by your attendance.</p>
<p>I noticed the disparity between the students the most during group assignments. Once at BMCC, I worked with a group to produce a final report which would make up a large portion of my grade. One of our group members disappeared part way through the semester and did not respond to any of our emails. Left in charge of her portion we had to split her work. On the final day of class, when we were slated to hand in our report, she showed up with a crumpled print-out with a paragraph which was supposed to represent her portion, fully expecting us incorporate it with our work. Baffled, we had to turn her down and let her know that her work was unacceptable. In comparison, at Columbia, I worked with a group to present a report in which we all agreed to go the extra mile and create a video showcasing our findings. All members of the group were active, engaged, and contributed beyond their fair share of work. Though this is only anecdotal evidence, I found comparisons between idiosyncratic differences in the student bodies different enough to be startling.</p>
<p>However, the student body was not without its flaws. Though racially diverse, the students at Columbia mostly came from the same privileged socioeconomic background. I found the school’s population to be homogenous. I was used to interacting with students with working class backgrounds from New York City. The difference was quite stark, and I found myself having a difficult time forming friendships with my peers. I naturally gravitated towards older, “unconventional” students, who were also returning to college, mostly military veterans. I didn’t have much time to socialize though. I had a carefully planned course schedule to adhere to if I was going to graduate on time. I stuck my nose in my books and worked harder than I had ever worked in my life.</p>
<h3 id="post-columbia">Post Columbia</h3>
<p>I graduated. It surprised me much more than it should have. In hindsight it wasn’t all just studying and stress, there were plenty of good times along with the bad. I met a lot of great people during my time, many who have gone on to do some impressive things. I had worked my way through two and a half years and landed an internship which eventually turned into a job. From there, I transitioned to my current role as a Data Analyst at Penguin Random House, the largest book publisher in the US. Without my education from Columbia, data analytics would be a complete mystery to me. Putting in the hours and studying outside of work isn’t a chore as it would have been prior to going back to school. An example of that is that since graduating, I’ve been able to teach myself programming. I had attempted to do so in the past but had never pushed through the tedious parts, always getting stuck. Also, thanks to the fundamental math and economic education I received, I find working with large data sets much easier.</p>
<p>Looking back at it now, I can appreciate the rigor and the intensity of the work. Columbia helped push my boundaries and helped me realize what I’m capable of doing. Just three years prior, I matriculated from BMCC, content with a future that was just slightly better than the one I left. However, I would never have even thought to reach so high had Dr. Poster not seen something in me and pushed me to apply. It’s truly amazing what an effect one person can have on the trajectory of another person’s life and I’m grateful to her for what she’s done for me. She made me promise that I would never remove BMCC from my resume, to show others what students from a community college could achieve. I leave it on there for her, and to remind myself of my roots.</p>]]></description>
